# Logged In Bottom Tab Navigator (https://youtu.be/ke1whnT5Cv8)

## Libraries:
1. react-navigation
2. react-native-vector-icons

## Tips:
1. Containers (as many as tabs) -> Logged In Tab Navigator (only 1) -> Logged In Screen (only 1)
2. To configure label and icon of the tab, add static navigationOptions to all containers
3. The navigation.js in styles folder is used to configure (remove) header/bar (transparentHeaderStyle)
